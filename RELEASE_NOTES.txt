* The MongoDB clients have been updated to the most recent version.
* Added the ``mongo-retrywrites`` configuration setting in ``deploy.cfg``, defaulting to ``false``.
* Switched the build system from Make / Ant to Gradle.
* The `lookup_globus_user` method was removed.
* The `globus-url` configuration parameter was removed.

## VERSION: 0.2.1 (Released 4/1/19)

* Updated the MongoDB client to 3.10.1, allowing for Mongo 3.x compatibility.
